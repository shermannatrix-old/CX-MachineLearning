# CX-MachineLearning
CX MachineLearning is an open sourced project built on top of Python 3.6 and MongoDB 3.2. The aim is to design and construct a fully optimised and elaborate library to track online consumer/user behavior, habits and make predictive analysis &amp; projects.

## Project Objectives
- To build a Machine Learning programme for tracking consumer's behaviors,
purchasing habits, preferences, user journeys and ultimately provide
predictive models and recommendations.

- Purely for research purpose, this project aims to help other developers
learning Python and Machine Learning to get acquainted with Machine
Learning concepts from an *"by the example"* approach.

- The objective of this project is to create an AI backbone that will
be fully automated and self-learning.

- To continuously seek the improvement of the library's codes (algorithms)
to ensure that the project is constantly up to date with framework updates
and coding efficiency.

- With the Machine Learning and simulated data completed, the goal is to
create a real-time dashboard that allows learners and educators to demonstrate
the capabilities of good machine learning application. With the Web API,
any development team can make use of the project to create their own dashboards,
or modify it for their school/research/commercial use.

## 2 Key Components of CX-MachineLearning
- MongoDB 3.2 Server
- Main Project (Python 3.6 + Flask-PyMongo)
    - ExMachina (machine learning library)
    - Web API (using Flask-PyMongo)
- Real-time Dashboard (In the near future)

## Looking to Collaborate?
If you are looking for an opportunity to collaborate on an open
sourced project using Python and MongoDB, you are welcomed to write in
to our team. We need folks for various aspects of the project:

- Machine Learning Hackers (coders basically)
- Creating of real-life simulated data (MongoDB skills required)
- Web API
- Regular updating of our documentation and API content. (Fluent with
Markdown syntax)
